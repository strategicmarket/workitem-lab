Issues can be created, but never deleted on GitHub. Issues can (only) be open, closed, or reopened.

Once an issue is created, it's given a unique and __permanent__ issue number.

This temporary repostiory is meant to be used for tests while the feature to create new work items from the marketplace is being developed.
